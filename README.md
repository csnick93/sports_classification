# README

This repo was created to play around with the [Kaggle Sports Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/logical-rythm-2k20-sports-image-classification). The main notebook is `SportsClassification.ipynb`, where the data is investigated, a model is trained and evaluated, as well as being converted to onnx format for more efficient inference.
