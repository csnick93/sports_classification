```{python}
from PIL import Image
from pathlib import Path
import os
```

```{python}
path = Path('data')
train_path = path/'train'
test_path = path/'test'
```

# Check the image dimensions

```{python}
train_shapes = [Image.open(train_path/f).size for f in os.listdir(train_path)]
```

```{python}
len(set(train_shapes))
```

Very different image dimensions, need to be resized on training.

```{python}

```
